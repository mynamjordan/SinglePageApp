                Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate
                technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the
                structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's
                behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business
                context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify
                stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible webbased applications.

            <p>
                All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These
                inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
                and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the
                Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process
                referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
                understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
                designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of
                the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes
            </p>

            <br/> 
            <p>
                Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities
                through the assurance of learning processes in each unit.

                    These learning activities in this unit include a mixture of reading, website study, watching videos, quizzes and other
                    online activities that enable students to self-test their understanding. Some activities will be story-lined; that is
                    must complete one activity before progressing. Students undertake other hands-on activities during weekly
                    workshops, interspersed with short lectures. Partial model solutions to some activities will be available on
                    Blackboard. Preparatory and workshop activities are on the Blackboard site.
