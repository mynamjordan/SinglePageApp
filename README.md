# Single Page Application Journel

* Need to sort out PDF to HTML

* Having the need to HTML, CSS, Script

* Ideas in mind, are creating a button that links to a sperate page
at this point found links for website only. If i am able to create each page i can enter in the information needed from the outline

* Found a better way to link another htm for each page of the unit outline https://stackoverflow.com/questions/908765/how-to-link-html-pages-in-same-or-different-folders 

However I don't know if this is the easiest way to path it nor do i know if we have learnt pathing like this


Most learning done was through googling and W3 Schools and youtube videos here and there

8/4/2022 - Reasearch and learning for 2 hours

10/4/2022 - Started to try code for 1 hours, the first page as i didnt know how to base the assignemnt i just did what i could
with the reseach that i had.

11/4/2022 - I created many HTMl pages that were able to corrolate to a link on the website however, this is not a single
page application it was a reloading page that loaded other HTML in the folder. I did spend around 3 hours doing the pages
And will think about what to do next tommorow.

12/4/2022 - Had serious issue where it was not a single page application but still try to make it work 7 hours. 
Praticially rebuilt my HTML and CSS. Allowed for better healthy practices towards css and not just styling it in HTML as seen in my other 'pages' folder
Basically Created a template, and did pages from 1-4, and page 10. I had in the first 3 hours just did the tables
as images cause I was scared to learn the table. But I tried to learn and it was easier than expected.
I Spend most of my time learning on formatting the pages and the listing on the sides. The other time
was spend doing one as I was learning the logic of div, one i learnt that aspect and the
format where everything goes it made more sense. 
W3 Schools was a huge tool as i didnt want to do anything fancy.
I also tried to Comment best as i can where i have used other sources to help me solidate my own code

13/4/2022 -Since the borders (pages) and List was done on the side it was easy to fill as i had done the past work in the old HTML. 
I have made edits based of the old one but it worked out pretty well. Finished edited and commented, 8 hours of work. A
Through out the 8 hours i did pages 5-9, making sure that the formatting was done well as well
also checked in with the validator for css and html there were some issues (Screen shots taken). CSS was validated. 
HTML was not, but the issues on it were very easy to fix, as seen with the images provided.
I also tried to Comment best as i can where i have used other sources to help me solidate my own code

14/3/2022 - 2 hours, Wrapping up the assignment

Again in terms of the sources i used i have linked them in the comments, but most of the reaserch was of the code
was done through W3 Schools and googling. Because the way i have formatted the template which is just a page on the
body and filling the pages with the nessecerray div, paragraphs, images, table or list, i just had to copy the info
from unit outline and make sure it looks similar as possible.

Total hours: 24 Hours 

W3C Validator Issues that were resolved
-Was Just duplicates of ID and that got deleted to be fixed
-Spelling Mistakes such as "_blanke" instead of "_blank"

Challenges 
* Many issues with the structure of the assignment, coming with many ideas of how to start the assignment
* I started the assignment on the multiple HTML pages wich is not apart of the SPA Assignment which was intreseting
* The only difficulty i had was trying to learn things that i may have forgotten in class and or in general 

Other than the challenges that were said, I tried to be basic so that the code i wrote is not too messy.
That also comes with learning best practices when it comes to comments and how to do the code.
