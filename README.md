# To Do list for Single Page Application 

* Need to sort out PDF to HTML

* Having the need to HTML, CSS, Script

* Ideas in mind, are creating a button that links to a sperate page
at this point found links for website only. If i am able to create each page i can enter in the information needed from the outline

* Or a button that click 'next' to a next page https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_next_prev I dont know if this would be easier to use as i would also have to make sure the user knows the 'number' of page

* Found source of link of linking to another html or htm https://programminghead.com/how-to-link-submit-button-to-another-page-in-html.php#:~:text=how%20to%20make%20a%20button%20or%20a%20page%20link%20to,the%20Path%20to%20your%20Button. 

* Found a better way to link another htm for each page of the unit outline https://stackoverflow.com/questions/908765/how-to-link-html-pages-in-same-or-different-folders 

However I don't know if this is the easiest way to path it nor do i know if we have learnt pathing like this
