# Single Page Application Journel

* Need to sort out PDF to HTML

* Having the need to HTML, CSS, Script

* Ideas in mind, are creating a button that links to a sperate page
at this point found links for website only. If i am able to create each page i can enter in the information needed from the outline

* Found a better way to link another htm for each page of the unit outline https://stackoverflow.com/questions/908765/how-to-link-html-pages-in-same-or-different-folders 

However I don't know if this is the easiest way to path it nor do i know if we have learnt pathing like this

Learnt how to do tables 

Most learning done was through googling and W3 Schools

8/4/2022 - Reasearch and learning for 2 hours

10/4/2022 - Started to try code for 2 hours

12/4/2022 - Learnt there were things not apart of html5 had to restart sort of, 3 hours

13/4/2022 - Had serious issue where it was not a single page application but still try to make it work 7 hours. Praticially rebuilt my HTML and CSS. Allowed for better healthy practices towards css and not just styling it in HTML as seen in my other 'pages' folder

14/4/2022 -Since the borders (pages) and List was done on the side it was easy to fill as i had done the past work in the old HTML. I have made edits based of the old one but it worked out pretty well. Finished edited and commented, 8 hours of work. Also checked in with the validator for css and html there were some issues (Screen shots taken). CSS was validated. HTML was not, but the issues on it were very easy to fix, as seen with the images provided.

Challenges 
* Many issues with the structure of the assignment, coming with many ideas of how to start the assignment
* I started the assignment on the multiple HTML pages wich is not apart of the SPA Assignment which was intreseting
* The only difficulty i had was trying to learn things that i may have forgotten in class and or in general 

The Assignment was enjoyable when it came to the creation of the project, and I have learnt a lot of new things that will help if i go into web development deeper.
