        <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
        <p>
            Students will develop and apply the skills necessary to design and implement business websites using appropriate
            technologies in this unit. This technology includes using HyperText Markup Language (HTML) to define the
            structure, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to determine the look and feel, JavaScript to provide a website's
            behaviour, and other supporting technologies and frameworks to provide for a rich user experience in a business
            context. Students will develop and apply professional skills in a web development environment to identify
            stakeholder requirements and select and implement appropriate technologies for responsive and accessible webbased applications.

       <p><b>Unit Learning Outcomes</b></p>
       <p>
           All graduates of Curtin University achieve a set of six Graduate Capabilities during their course of study. These
           inform an employer that, through your studies, you have acquired discipline knowledge and a range of other skills
           and capabilities which employers would value in a professional setting. Each unit in your course addresses the
           Graduate Capabilities through a clearly identified set of learning outcomes. They form a vital part in the process
           referred to as assurance of learning. The learning outcomes notify you of what you are expected to know,
           understand or be able to do in order to be successful in this unit. Each assessment for this unit is carefully
           designed to test your knowledge of one or more of the unit learning outcomes. On successfully completing all of
           the assessments you will have achieved all of these learning outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
           Your course has been designed so that on graduating you will have achieved all of Curtin's Graduate Capabilities
           through the assurance of learning processes in each unit
