            These learning activities in this unit include a mixture of reading, website study, watching videos, quizzes and other
            online activities that enable students to self-test their understanding. Some activities will be story-lined; that is
            must complete one activity before progressing. Students undertake other hands-on activities during weekly
            workshops, interspersed with short lectures. Partial model solutions to some activities will be available on
            Blackboard. Preparatory and workshop activities are on the Blackboard site.
