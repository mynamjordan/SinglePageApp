        <h3>
            Academic Integrity (including plagiarism and cheating)
        </h3>
        <h4>Academic Integrity</h4>
        <p>
            Curtin's Student Charter, Academic Integrity Program (AIP), and core Values guide expectations regarding student
            behaviour and responsibilities. Information on these topics can be found on the Academic Integrity Website.
        </p>

        <h4>Academic Integrity Warnings</h4>
        <p>
            An Academic Integrity Warning may be issued to a New-to-Curtin student in limited circumstances and only where
            misconduct is not involved.
        </p>

        <h4>Academic Misconduct</h4>
        <p>
            Staff members are required to report suspected misconduct. Academic Misconduct means conduct by a student
            that is dishonest or unfair in connection with any academic work. This includes all types of plagiarism, cheating,
            collusion, falsification or fabrication of content, and behaviours like falsifying medical certificates for extension.
            Contract cheating, the use of file sharing, translation services/apps, paraphrasing tools (text-spinners) and
            assignment help websites also may be considered academic misconduct. The longer term personal, social, and
            financial consequences of misconduct can be severe, so please ask for help if you are unsure.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your work is the subject of an inquiry, you will be given an opportunity to respond and appropriate support will
            be provided. Academic work under inquiry will not be graded until the process has concluded. Penalties for
            misconduct may include a warning, a reduced or nil grade, a requirement to repeat the assessment, an annulled
            grade (ANN) or termination from the course. For more information refer to Statute No.10 Student Discipline and
            Academic Misconduct Rules.
