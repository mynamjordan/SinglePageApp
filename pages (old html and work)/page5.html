        <p><b>Fair asessment through moderation</b></p>
        <p>
            Moderation describes a quality assurance process to ensure that assessments are appropriate to the learning
            outcomes, and that students work is evaluated consistently by assessors. Minimum standards for the moderation
            of assessments are described in the Assessment and Student Progression Manual, available from
            policies.curtin.edu.au/findapolicy/
