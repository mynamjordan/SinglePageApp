        <h3> Student Requity</h3>
        <p>
            There are a number of factors that might disadvantage some students from participating in their studies or
            assessments to the best of their ability, under standard conditions. These factors may include a disability or
            medical condition (e.g. mental illness, chronic illness, physical or sensory disability, learning disability), significant
            caring responsibilities, pregnancy, religious practices, living in a remote location,or another reason. If you believe
            you may be unfairly disadvantaged on these or other grounds please contact the appropriate service below. It is
            important to note that the staff of the University may not be able to meet your needs if they are not informed of
            your individual circumstances, so please get in touch with the appropriate service if you require assistance.
